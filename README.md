#  Project Overview

- The Face Recognition Attendance System is a Flask-based web application designed to automate student attendance tracking using face recognition technology.
- It aims to minimize absenteeism, reduce manual errors, and help lecturers monitor class participation efficiently.
- This system addresses the challenge of unreliable manual attendance systems and leverages AI-powered face detection
- and recognition to ensure secure, tamper-proof attendance recording.

# Motivation
- High student absenteeism contributes significantly to low academic performance and drop-out rates in universities.
- Traditional attendance methods (signing sheets, roll calls) are time-consuming, prone to fraud, and lack proper data integrity.

# This system was developed to:

- Ensure accurate and automated attendance marking.
- Eliminate human intervention and manipulation.
- Provide real-time attendance data for lecturers and administrators.

‚öôÔ∏è System Features
- Face Recognition Attendance
1. Automatically detects and identifies student faces using a camera.
2. Marks attendance in real-time without manual input.

- User Authentication

1. Secure login for lecturers and admins.
2. Role-based access to attendance data.

- Attendance Records Management
1. Stores attendance history securely in the database.
2. Prevents tampering with attendance records.

- Performance Integration
1. Allows lecturers to allocate marks for attendance as part of a student‚Äôs continuous assessment.

- Flask Web Interface
1. Simple, user-friendly dashboard for lecturers and admins to view attendance data.

- How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ZUBENATHI-SAMKILE/Attendance-System-main.git
cd FaceRecognitionAttendance

 2.Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3Ô∏è. Run the Application
python run.py

4Ô∏è. Access the System

Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

- Usage

1. Register Students ‚Äî Add student details and capture their face data. 

2. Train Model ‚Äî The system encodes and saves facial features for recognition.

3. Mark Attendance ‚Äî When a student appears before the camera, their face is detected and attendance recorded automatically.

4. View Records ‚Äî Lecturers can log in to check daily/weekly attendance and allocate participation marks.

üîí Security

- Dut students email only allowed for registration.
- Attendance data cannot be altered manually.
- Only authorized users (lecturers/admins) can access attendance records.
- Each student‚Äôs identity is verified through facial features to prevent proxy attendance.

-Team & Contributions
Developed by a student team as part of a university research and system development project focused on enhancing attendance accuracy and student engagement using AI and Flask technology.
